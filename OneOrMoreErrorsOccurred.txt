When opening the context menu for refactorings during debugging and a message box with the text
"One or more errors occurred" appears, try the following

Go to the directory 
C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\VisualStudio
Delete the folder 14.0Roslyn.
This forces a reset of the VS instances that are started for the debug session.
