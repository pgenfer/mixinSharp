[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/u8nvb20x3y87h0ay?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/pgenfer/mixinsharp)

MixinSharp (or shorter: mixin#) is a code refactoring extension for Visual Studio 2015 that adds mixin support to C# by auto generating the required code.  
The VSIX binary installation file can be found in the [Visual Studio Gallery](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/05c8154b-eb71-45f1-986e-923acca556f1), the full source code is available here. 

## what are mixins?

Mixins are a software concept that provides code reuse by *composition* instead of *inheritance*.  
The code that should be reused is placed in a separate class (the *mixin*) and any other class (in this context also called a *child* class) that wants to use this code simply holds a reference to the mixin and delegates method calls to it.  
For the ouside standing caller it looks like that the child instance is handling the request directly.  
 
## why are they useful?

Compared to classical inheritance, mixins have some advantages. Please check the [wiki](https://github.com/pgenfer/mixinSharp/wiki/Mixins---An-Overview) for a more detailed comparison between the both approaches.  
Unfortunately, C# does not support mixins directly on a language level, that's where mixinSharp comes into play by offering a refactoring step that automatically creates the required mixin code.

## a simple example

your mixin class with the code you want to reuse
```csharp
public class NameMixin
{
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public override string ToString() => Name;
}
```
the class where you want to include your mixin (your child)
```csharp
public class Person
{
  private NameMixin _name = new NameMixin();
}
```
Open the *Quick Action" context menu while your cursor is on your ``` _name``` field declaration:    

![Quick action](https://github.com/pgenfer/mixinSharp/blob/master/images/quick_action.png)    

From the context menu that popped up, choose the entry *Include mixin: 'name'*    

![Include mixin](https://github.com/pgenfer/mixinSharp/blob/master/images/mixin_preview.png)  

After applying the mixin refactoring, your mixin class is included in your child:
```csharp
public class Person
{
  private NameMixin _name = new NameMixin();
  public string Name
  {
    get { return _name.Name; }
    set { _name.Name = value; }
  }
  
  public override string ToString() => _name.ToString();
}
```

## Installation Instruction
mixinSharp is a Visual Studio 2015 Extension (VSIX), as such it can be downloaded from the [Visual Studio Gallery](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/05c8154b-eb71-45f1-986e-923acca556f1).  
After downloading the VSIX file, doubleclicking it will start the installation process.    

To compile the extension from source, you will have to install the [.NET Compiler Platform SDK](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/2ddb7240-5249-4c8c-969e-5d05823bcb89) first (but Visual Studio will automatically ask you to do so during the build).
